# Linear-Regression-Sample-Project
 Hyundai Heavy Industries need help to build a predictive model for some ships. [Hyundai Heavy Industries](http://www.hyundai.eu/en) is one of the world's largest ship manufacturing companies and builds cruise liners.

They need help to give accurate estimates of how many crew members a ship will require.

They are currently building new ships for some customers and want  to create a model and use it to predict how many crew members the ships will need.

Here is what the data looks like so far:

    Description: Measurements of ship size, capacity, crew, and age for 158 cruise
    ships.


    Variables/Columns
    Ship Name     1-20
    Cruise Line   21-40
    Age (as of 2013)   46-48
    Tonnage (1000s of tons)   50-56
    passengers (100s)   58-64
    Length (100s of feet)  66-72
    Cabins  (100s)   74-80
    Passenger Density   82-88
    Crew  (100s)   90-96
    
It is saved in a csv file for you called "cruise_ship_info.csv". The goal is to create a regression model that will help predict how many crew members will be needed for future ships. The client also mentioned that they have found that particular cruise lines will differ in acceptable crew counts, so it is most likely an important feature to include in your analysis!
